<ul>
  <li>I worked as a commercial photographer for over a decade.</li>
  <li>I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript originally in college & returned to development in 2018</li>

  <li>March through July 2019 was spent as a Full Stack Developer at Zulily (where I worked from 2013 - 2020) and am looking for a full-time developer job.</li>
