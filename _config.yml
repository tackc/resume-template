<ul>
  <li>I'm a career-changing full-stack developer.</li>
  <li>I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript originally in college & then spent a few years away from development.</li>
  <li>I spent all of 2018 reacquainting myself with what's new in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and much more (self-taught and via attending a 12-week course).</li>
  <li>March through July 2019 was spent as a Software Development Engineer at Zulily (where I have worked since 2013) and am looking for a full-time developer job.</li>
</ul></p>"
